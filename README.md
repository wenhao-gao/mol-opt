# mol-opt: a Python Toolbox for Molecular Design

## üöÄ Installation 
To get started with our package, please first ensure that PyTorch is installed with a CUDA version compatible with your device. You can find detailed installation instructions on [the official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Once PyTorch is set up, you can install the remaining dependencies for our package by executing:
```
python setup.py install 
```
Please note, our package has been tested and confirmed to work with Python 3.8. We recommend using this version to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.

## üíª Usage

```python
from molopt.graph_ga import GraphGA
optimizer = GraphGA(smi_file=None, n_jobs=-1, max_oracle_calls=10000, freq_log=100, output_dir = 'results', log_results=True) 
optimizer.optimize(oracle='qed', config='path_to_your_hparams.yaml', patience=5, seed=0)
```
